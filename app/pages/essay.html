    <h1>Spacetime's Structure, Perception & Intention, and the Case Against Ethical Non-Monogamy</h1>

    <div id='essay'>&emsp;I was exchanging messages with a person on a chat app called Discord and one of her messages showed up after mine. When I opened the app later, her message showed up before mine. This suggests that time is discrete and not continuous. Two events can happen simultaneously, in the exact same moment. The difference in time between when we sent our messages was smaller than an infinitesimally small measure of time. That amount of time is not significant enough that it is possible to measure it at all. The length of that amount of time is known in physics as Planck time.<br>
    &emsp;Picture the space that makes up our universe as a sphere that has been expanding since the Big Bang. On the outside edge of the sphere of our universe, each discrete piece of time is shaped like a curved circle on the surface of that sphere. As space expands, the sizes of these circles grow. These time circles do not exist inside of the currently expanding sphere that is space. They exist on the outside surface of that sphere. They are two-dimensional.<br>
    &emsp;That is why time can feel like it is moving quickly and slowly at the same time. We are not moving through time. Time surrounds us.<br>
    &emsp;Gravity is a force that is inherent to the fabric of spacetime. Black holes in our universe form the center of suns in other universes. Matter that falls into black holes emerges into these other universes and is instantly incinerated by the suns in them.<br>
    &emsp;Physicists theorize that the ultimate fate of our universe is that it will end in heat death. This theory predicts that our universe will spread out and expand into a state in which there is no thermodynamic free energy. At that point, it will be unable to sustain processes that increase entropy and it will have reached a state of thermodynamic equilibrium.<br>
    &emsp;I postulate that, when this happens, all of the circles that rest on the surface of the sphere that is space will expand to infinite sizes. They will explosively crowd out the void in which spacetime exists. Our universe will end, and a new one will begin. The new one might be exactly like ours except for a slight difference in one of the values of a single physical constant, or it might be wildly different in ways we cannot begin to fathom.<br><br>
    &emsp;There are some videos on the Internet of a person speaking, and there are multiple words or phrases on the screen. The word or phrase the viewer perceives from the audio track depends on which word or phrase they focus on while they are watching and listening to the video. This confusing trick only works because the audio track was recorded on digital equipment. If it had been recorded on magnetic tape, it would be clear what word or phrase the speaker intended to say no matter what the listener focused on when they heard it. Digital equipment uses discrete bits, which are more similar to the fabric of time than analog recording media. Multiple words or phrases can exist in the same bits of digital media simultaneously. Your focus determines what you hear.<br><br>
    &emsp;Have you ever met someone who says they have a bunch of “best friends?” The more literal amongst us may protest that they can’t all be “best.” Surely, there can only be one winner of that title. I propose that it is the intention of this social butterfly that matters most. Just like we can hear multiple words and phrases in the same short audio recording of a person who intended to say a specific word or phrase, a person who intends to have a few best friends can make that intention felt by those subjects of their friendship.<br>
    &emsp;Romantic relationships are different. People who believe that they have found “The One,” or their one true love, are happiest in their relationships. The concept of a one true love is not meant to suggest that every individual is destined to meet one other person and that no one else in the universe could have made them feel that they had met their one true love. It simply describes deep romantic love and satisfaction.<br>
    &emsp;Ethical non-monogamy is an oxymoron. Everyone would be happier if they put in the effort to find someone to whom they could commit long-term. It can be easier said than done, but it is better than being sad. Thanks for reading, and feel free to share this!
